# Noni MongoDB

This module wraps the mongodb driver API with ones from 
[@quenk/noni](https://github.com/quenktechnologies/noni) for easier use 
with projects depending on that library.

It avoids adding too much to the functions mongodb exports, mostly simplifying
arguments and wrapping results in noni data types.

Only functions we actually use at QT are included here, additional ones may
be added in the future but there is no guarantee.
